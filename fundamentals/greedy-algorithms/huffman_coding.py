------------------
Implementationof huffman Coding using a Greedy Algorithm in Python.

Background:
    - Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm
    - It assigns variable-length binary codes to input symbols
      such that more frequent symbols get shorter codes
    - The result is a prefix-free binary encoding tree (node code
       is a prefix of another / doesnt start with same binary codes)

Problem:
    - given a set of characters and their frequencies, build an 
      optimal binary prefix code that minimizes the total cost:
    - Cost =  Î£ (frequency(char) * length(code(char)))

Goal:
    - Minimize the average code length (bits per symbol)
    - Encode frequent symbols using fewer bits

Main Idea (Greedy Strategy):
    1. Start with all symbols as separate nodes with their frequencies.
    2. Repeatedly merge the two nodes with the lowest frequencies.
        > Create a new internal node whose frequency is the sum of the two
        > Attach the two as left and right children
    3. Continue merging until only one node (the root) remains
    4. Traverse the tree:
        > Assign 0 to left edges and 1 to right edges to form the code

Why Greed Works:
    - Greedy-choice property: Combining the two least frequent symbols first
      never prevents an optimal prefix code
    - Optimal substructure: After merging two symbols, the remaining (reduced
      alphabet) has the same optimal structure

Time Complexity:
    - Building the tree: O(n logn)
    - Generating codes: O(n)
    - Total: O(n logn)

Space Complexity:
    - O(n): For the heap (priority queue) and Huffman tree
