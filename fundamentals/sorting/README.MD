# Bubble Sort

This folder contains a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Python.

## Description
Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
It’s simple but inefficient for large datasets.

- **Best case:** O(n) (already sorted)
- **Average/Worst case:** O(n²)
- **Stable:** Yes
- **In-place:** Yes

## Example
Input:  [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]  
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
