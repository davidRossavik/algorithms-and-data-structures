# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is a personal learning and practice space for algorithms and data structures.
It combines both **theoretical exercises** (like sorting, dynamic programming, and trees) and **practical projects** that apply these concepts to real-world inspired problems.

## Goals

* Strengthen algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.
* Practice writing clean, well-documented, and tested code.
* Explore how data structures and algorithms are applied in real systems.
* Limited / No AI use

## Languages Used

This repository includes implementations mainly in **Python**.

---

## How to Run

Each subproject contains its own `README.md` with:

* Problem description
* Algorithm explanation
* How to run the code
* Example input/output

---

## Learning Log

I'm currently studying *TDT4120 - Algorithms and Data Structures* at NTNU.
This repository reflects the topics covered in the course â€” extended with personal explorations and experiments.

---

## Future Ideas

* Implement visualization of dynamic programming states
* Build a small web interface for algorithm animations
* Explore parallel sorting algorithms
* Compare recursive vs iterative approaches
